# **Generative AI: GANs, Diffusion, and the Probabilistic Backbone**

### **From Distribution Learning to Modern Image and Language Generators**

**Focus:** revision that captures the whole course, but puts the real weight where it belongs here: **GANs** and **Diffusion Models**.

---

# Why this course matters in robotics and AI

Generative AI is not just “make pretty images.”

It is the study of how to **model data distributions**, **sample from them**, **learn useful latent structure**, and **generate new observations** that are statistically and semantically consistent with the world.

That matters in robotics more than it first appears.

You see it in:
- **synthetic data generation** for perception systems,
- **world modeling** and latent-state learning,
- **uncertainty-aware modeling** of observations,
- **image and scene generation** for simulation and training,
- **3D generation** for design, planning, and embodied AI,
- **vision-language models** that need generative pretraining,
- **diffusion-based policy and trajectory models** in newer robotics pipelines,
- **language models** that serve as planning, reasoning, and interface layers.

This course matters because it connects several worlds that are often taught separately:
- probability and statistics,
- latent-variable modeling,
- adversarial learning,
- score-based generative modeling,
- evaluation of generative systems,
- and modern sequence modeling with attention.

The real lesson is that generative AI is not one trick.
It is a family of ways to approximate or manipulate distributions over complex data.

# Big Picture Map

At the highest level, this course answers eight giant questions.

## 1. What does it mean to learn a generative model?

> Learn a distribution that approximates how the data could have been produced.

## 2. Why is high-dimensional generation hard?

Because histograms and explicit probability tables explode combinatorially with dimension.

## 3. Why do latent variables matter?

> Because useful high-dimensional data often lives near a much lower-dimensional latent structure.

## 4. What is the main split in modern generative modeling?

Between:
- **likelihood / variational models** like VAEs,
- **adversarial models** like GANs,
- **score / diffusion models** like DDPMs.

## 5. What is a GAN really trying to do?

> Train a generator by playing a game against a discriminator / critic so the generated distribution becomes hard to distinguish from the real one.

## 6. What is a diffusion model really trying to do?

> Learn how to reverse a gradual noising process, which turns density modeling into iterative denoising.

## 7. How do we compare generative models?

With divergences, integral probability metrics, kernels, MMD, and practical metrics like IS and FID.

## 8. Why did the course end with language models and attention?

Because large language models are also generative models, just over token sequences rather than pixels.

# Notation and foundational objects

We work with random variables, distributions, latent variables, and learned generators.

**Observed data:**

$$
x \in \mathcal{X}
$$

**Latent variable:**

$$
z \in \mathcal{Z}
$$

**True data distribution:**

$$
p^{*}(x)
$$

**Model distribution:**

$$
p_{\theta}(x)
$$

**Latent-variable generative model:**

$$
p_{\theta}(x,z)=p_{\theta}(z)\,p_{\theta}(x\mid z)
$$

**Approximate posterior / encoder:**

$$
q_{\phi}(z\mid x)
$$

**GAN generator:**

$$
x_g = G_{\theta}(z), \qquad z \sim p(z)
$$

**GAN discriminator / critic:**

$$
D_{\omega}(x)
$$

**Diffusion latent at time step $t$:**

$$
x_t
$$

**Score function:**

$$
s(x) = \nabla_x \log p(x)
$$

**Autoregressive language model:**

The probability of a full token sequence is written as a product of next-token probabilities conditioned on the previous tokens.

In plain form:

`p(sequence) = p(x1) * p(x2 | x1) * p(x3 | x1, x2) * ... * p(xT | x1, ..., xT-1)`

This means the model generates or scores text one token at a time, always using the past context to predict the next token.

# Module 1: Probabilistic Foundations and Why Generation Is Hard

## 1.1 What the course starts with

The professor notes start from a very old but very important question:

> if I observe data samples, what does it even mean to estimate the underlying distribution?

That is the right opening.

Before GANs and diffusion become cool, we need to understand:
- random variables,
- sample spaces,
- discrete vs continuous distributions,
- empirical estimates,
- how many samples are needed for reliable estimation,
- and why naive histogram learning dies in high dimension.

## 1.2 The curse of explicit distribution estimation

If a feature space is tiny, we can estimate probabilities directly.
If the space is high-dimensional, that plan collapses.

Why?
Because the number of possible outcomes grows exponentially with dimension.

That means:
- low-probability events are rarely seen,
- empirical histograms are sparse,
- and sample complexity becomes absurd.

This is the first deep reason generative modeling needs **structure**.

## 1.3 Distances between distributions matter

The notes repeatedly ask some version of:

> how do we compare one estimated distribution to another?

That question becomes central later in GANs, WGANs, MMD, and FID.

The basic moral is:
- not every comparison is a metric,
- some divergences are asymmetric,
- different objectives induce different training behavior.

## 1.4 Inverse transform sampling intuition

The course also reviews inverse-CDF sampling.
That matters because it reminds you of a core generative idea:

> if you know a distribution well enough, you can sample from it.

That sounds obvious, but it is the conceptual seed of all later generative models:
- choose a simple noise source,
- learn a transformation,
- turn simple randomness into structured samples.

## 1.5 Why this foundation matters

Without these opening ideas, later model families just look like disconnected hacks.

With them, the course becomes a clean story:
- direct estimation fails,
- so we introduce latent structure,
- then we learn generation indirectly through objectives that are actually tractable.

# Module 2: PCA, PPCA, and Latent-Space Intuition

## 2.1 Why PCA appears in a GenAI course

Because PCA is the cleanest first example of the idea that:

> high-dimensional data may live near a lower-dimensional structure.

That idea never leaves.
It becomes:
- latent variables in VAEs,
- noise-to-data maps in GANs,
- latent spaces in diffusion pipelines,
- embeddings in LLMs.

## 2.2 PCA as linear compression

Given data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, PCA finds a $q$-dimensional linear subspace that minimizes reconstruction error.

The reconstruction form is:

$$
x_i \approx \mu + V_q \lambda_i
$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the mean,
- $V_q$ contains the top principal directions,
- $\lambda_i$ are low-dimensional coordinates.

So PCA says:
- center the data,
- compute covariance,
- keep the top eigenvectors,
- project to a lower-dimensional latent space.

## 2.3 PPCA as probabilistic latent-variable thinking

Probabilistic PCA makes the latent-space story explicit.

The data is modeled as generated from:
- a low-dimensional latent Gaussian,
- a linear map,
- plus Gaussian noise.

That is a huge conceptual bridge.

It tells you that generation can be viewed as:
1. sample a latent variable,
2. map it upward into data space,
3. add appropriate uncertainty.

That is basically baby-VAE energy.

## 2.4 Why this matters later

PCA and PPCA are not the final answer.
They are the clean toy version of a much more general worldview:

- hidden structure exists,
- data is generated from something lower-dimensional,
- generation is easier in latent space than raw space.

# Module 3: GANs - The First Main Boss

## 3.1 What a GAN is really doing

A GAN trains two models in opposition.

### Generator
Takes simple latent noise and maps it into a fake sample.

$$
x_g = G_{\theta}(z), \qquad z \sim p(z)
$$

### Discriminator
Looks at a sample and tries to tell whether it is real or generated.

$$
D_{\omega}(x) \in [0,1]
$$

So GAN training is not direct likelihood fitting.
It is a **game**.

## 3.2 Vanilla GAN objective

The canonical minimax objective is:

$$
\min_G \max_D V(D,G)
$$

with

$$
V(D,G)=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_r}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))]
$$

Interpretation:
- the discriminator wants high score on real data,
- low score on generated data,
- the generator wants generated data to fool the discriminator.

## 3.3 Why the discriminator is basically a classifier

The notes explicitly connect GAN training to supervised binary classification.

That matters.
Because the discriminator is not mystical:
it is just learning a decision boundary between:
- class 1 = real,
- class 0 = fake.

This is why logistic / cross-entropy style losses appear naturally.

## 3.4 Optimal discriminator and Jensen-Shannon divergence

For fixed $G$, the optimal discriminator has a closed form:

$$
D^{*}(x)=\frac{p_r(x)}{p_r(x)+p_g(x)}
$$

Plugging that back into the value function yields the Jensen-Shannon divergence relation.

So vanilla GAN training can be interpreted as pushing the generator toward the real data distribution by minimizing a JS-based objective.

That is one of the most important conceptual facts in the whole GAN block.

## 3.5 Why vanilla GANs are cool and cursed

Cool because:
- they can generate sharp samples,
- they avoid explicit density computation,
- they made deep generative modeling explode into mainstream attention.

Cursed because training is notoriously unstable.

The notes explicitly call out classic issues:
- vanishing gradients,
- exploding gradients,
- mode collapse,
- mode oscillation.

That is not bad implementation luck.
That is the structure of the game being messy.

## 3.6 The non-saturating generator trick

In practice, the generator is often not trained with the original saturating minimax form.

Instead, a more useful objective is the non-saturating version that directly encourages:
- large discriminator score on generated samples,
- and therefore stronger gradients early in training.

Practical message:
**the theoretical minimax objective and the optimization you actually run are not always the same thing.**

## 3.7 GAN mental model that actually sticks

A good mental model is:

- the generator is learning to transport simple noise into the shape of the data,
- the discriminator is learning a signal that says where generated samples still look wrong,
- the generator follows that signal.

When that signal is informative, training works.
When it is weak or pathological, you get collapse and chaos.

## 3.8 DCGAN and architectural discipline

The course reading assignments mention DCGAN because architecture matters.

GAN success is not just the loss.
It is also about:
- convolutional structure,
- normalization choices,
- upsampling strategy,
- stable discriminator / generator balance.

So one of the silent lessons here is:

> generative modeling is never just objective design. Representation design matters too.

## 3.9 f-GAN viewpoint

The course then generalizes beyond JS.

f-GANs start from an $f$-divergence and derive a GAN-like variational objective.

That is conceptually huge.
It says:
- GANs are not one fixed game,
- different divergence choices produce different adversarial objectives,
- the training behavior changes with that choice.

So now you stop thinking “GAN = one formula” and start thinking “GAN = adversarial optimization framework induced by a divergence choice.”

## 3.10 WGAN: why Wasserstein shows up

Vanilla GANs struggle especially when real and generated distributions have weak overlap.

The notes motivate Wasserstein distance as a more geometry-aware notion of discrepancy.

Earth Mover intuition:
- how much mass has to move,
- how far it has to move,
- to turn one distribution into the other.

That is a much more stable notion than “pure overlap-based divergence only.”

## 3.11 WGAN objective intuition

WGAN replaces the probability-style discriminator with a **critic**.
It does not output “probability of real.”
It outputs a scalar score.

The objective is designed to estimate Wasserstein-1 distance under a Lipschitz constraint on the critic.

This is the heart of the shift:
- vanilla GAN discriminator = classifier,
- WGAN critic = constrained scoring function.

## 3.12 Why Lipschitz matters

WGAN theory requires the critic to be 1-Lipschitz.

The first practical enforcement trick was weight clipping.
But the notes point out the better modern fix:

### WGAN-GP
Use a gradient penalty instead of crude clipping.

This penalizes deviations of gradient norm from 1 on interpolated samples between real and fake points.

Why this matters:
- weight clipping can mutilate optimization,
- gradient penalty enforces the needed geometry more gracefully.

## 3.13 What WGAN actually fixes

WGAN does not magically make GANs easy.
But it improves some core pathologies:
- smoother learning signal,
- better behaved training curves,
- more meaningful critic objective,
- better sensitivity to distribution geometry.

That is why it became such a big deal.

## 3.14 GAN section distilled

If you forget everything else, keep this:

1. Vanilla GAN = adversarial distribution matching via a discriminator.
2. The game links to JS divergence.
3. Training instability is structural, not just annoying.
4. f-GAN says divergence choice matters.
5. WGAN replaces overlap-sensitive divergence with transport-style geometry.
6. WGAN-GP enforces the critic constraint much better than clipping.

That is the real conceptual chain.

# Module 4: Metrics, Kernels, MMD, and Evaluation

## 4.1 Why this section matters

A generative model is only as good as your way of asking:

> good according to what?

That is why the course spends serious time on kernels, mean embeddings, MMD, KDE, and FID/IS.

## 4.2 Kernel feature maps and distribution embeddings

The notes build the idea that a kernel can map data into a richer feature space where linear comparisons become more expressive.

Then distributions can be represented by **expected feature maps**:

$$
\mu_P = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim P}[\phi(x)]
$$

This is called a mean embedding.

That idea is beautiful because it turns distribution comparison into geometry in a feature space.

## 4.3 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

MMD compares two distributions by taking the largest mean difference over a function class, or equivalently by comparing their kernel mean embeddings.

Conceptually:
- if the function class is rich enough,
- MMD is zero iff the two distributions match.

So MMD gives a non-adversarial way to compare generated and real samples.

## 4.4 Why MMD matters in a GenAI course

Because it trains your brain to think beyond “one magic GAN loss.”

Distribution matching can be done through:
- KL-like divergences,
- JS,
- Wasserstein / IPMs,
- kernel methods like MMD.

That broader viewpoint makes the course intellectually much cleaner.

## 4.5 KDE and density estimation intuition

Kernel density estimation also appears because it is a reminder that even when explicit density estimation is possible in principle, the choice of smoothing kernel and bandwidth changes everything.

That helps explain why deep generative modeling exists at all:
naive density estimation is too brittle in complex spaces.

## 4.6 Practical evaluation: Inception Score and FID

The notes mention:
- **Inception Score (IS)**,
- **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**.

### IS intuition
Generated images should lead to:
- confident predictions for each sample,
- but diverse predictions across samples.

### FID intuition
Embed real and generated images in a vision feature space, model them approximately as Gaussians, then compare means and covariances.

Practical truth:
- IS says something,
- FID says something else,
- neither is the entire truth.

Evaluation is always a proxy.

# Module 5: VAEs and ELBO - The Likelihood/Latent Side of the Story

## 5.1 What a VAE is really doing

A VAE combines:
- a latent-variable generative model,
- an approximate posterior encoder,
- variational optimization.

The basic structure is:

$$
p_{\theta}(x,z)=p_{\theta}(z)\,p_{\theta}(x\mid z)
$$

with encoder

$$
q_{\phi}(z\mid x)
$$

This is the clean probabilistic latent-space route to generation.

## 5.2 Why the posterior is a problem

The true posterior $p_{\theta}(z\mid x)$ is usually intractable.
So we replace it with a learned approximation $q_{\phi}(z\mid x)$.

That is the move.
Not exact inference, but trainable approximate inference.

## 5.3 ELBO

The evidence lower bound is the training objective:

$$
\log p_{\theta}(x) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z\mid x)}[\log p_{\theta}(x,z)-\log q_{\phi}(z\mid x)]
$$

Equivalent decomposition:
- reconstruction term,
- KL regularization term.

In practical VAE language:
- one part wants good reconstruction / decoding,
- the other part keeps the latent posterior close to the prior.

## 5.4 Reparameterization trick

For continuous latent variables, we make sampling differentiable by writing:

$$
z = \mu(x) + \sigma(x) \odot \epsilon, \qquad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)
$$

This is one of the highest-value tricks in modern generative modeling.

It lets us backpropagate through stochastic latent sampling without losing our mind.

## 5.5 What VAEs are good at

VAEs are strong when you care about:
- principled latent-variable modeling,
- inference and generation together,
- smooth latent spaces,
- likelihood-style training,
- semantically meaningful compression.

## 5.6 What the course wants you to remember

The VAE block is important, but in this course it is mainly part of the conceptual backbone:
- latent variables,
- ELBO,
- variational inference,
- reparameterization,
- the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization.

And it sets up the diffusion block nicely, because diffusion is also taught through ELBO language before being reinterpreted as score learning.

# Module 6: Diffusion Models - The Second Main Boss

## 6.1 Core intuition

A diffusion model learns generation by first defining a **forward noising process** that gradually destroys structure, then learning a **reverse denoising process** that reconstructs it.

That is the core miracle.

Instead of learning “data from scratch” directly, we learn:

> how to remove noise one small step at a time.

## 6.2 Forward process

The forward process is a Markov chain that adds Gaussian noise step by step:

$$
q(x_t\mid x_{t-1})
$$

with variance schedule determined by coefficients like $\alpha_t$ or related notation.

The notes emphasize the **variance-preserving** setup where repeated noise eventually sends the data toward an approximately Gaussian endpoint.

So after enough noising:
- structure is gone,
- terminal latent is close to standard normal.

## 6.3 Closed-form noisy sample from clean data

A crucial point in the notes is that due to Gaussian composition, we can sample a noisy state directly from $x_0$ using one noise draw.

That means training does **not** require simulating every intermediate step during the forward pass in the most naive way.

This is a very important implementation insight.

## 6.4 Reverse process

Generation uses a learned reverse chain:

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}\mid x_t)
$$

Typically this reverse conditional is modeled as Gaussian with mean predicted by a neural network and variance tied to the schedule or partially learned.

So the reverse process says:
- start from Gaussian noise,
- repeatedly denoise,
- end with a structured sample.

## 6.5 Why ELBO appears in diffusion

The notes explicitly develop diffusion through an ELBO / variational route.

That matters because it shows diffusion is not an unrelated magical replacement for VAEs.

It still fits the broader probabilistic modeling tradition:
- define a latent-variable chain,
- derive a lower bound / KL decomposition,
- simplify the terms,
- optimize what remains.

## 6.6 The huge simplification

This is the real pivot:

The ELBO terms simplify so that training becomes equivalent to learning one of a few related prediction targets:
- predicted clean sample $x_0$,
- predicted noise $\epsilon$,
- predicted score.

The notes repeatedly emphasize the equivalence of these optimization views.

This is the reason diffusion feels tractable instead of horrifying.

## 6.7 Noise prediction view

In practice, a very common training target is the noise that was added to obtain $x_t$ from $x_0$.

That is elegant because:
- the ground-truth noise is known during training,
- the network learns denoising indirectly,
- and reverse-step mean formulas can be recovered from that estimate.

So diffusion often looks like “predict the corruption” rather than “predict the whole data distribution directly.”

## 6.8 Score-based interpretation

The notes make a major conceptual jump:

diffusion training can be interpreted as **score estimation**.

The score function is:

$$
\nabla_x \log p(x)
$$

Interpretation:
- it points toward regions of higher density,
- it acts like a vector field over data space,
- if you know it well enough, you can move noisy samples toward modes.

That links diffusion to score-based generative modeling and Fisher divergence minimization.

This is one of the most important insights in the course.

## 6.9 Why score matching is so useful

A density $p(x)$ may be hard to normalize explicitly.
But the score uses:

$$
\nabla_x \log p(x)
$$

which does **not** care about the unknown normalizing constant.

That is a gigantic advantage.
It means we can learn the geometry of the distribution without ever writing the full density in a clean closed form.

## 6.10 Continuous-time SDE viewpoint

The later diffusion lectures move from discrete diffusion steps to continuous-time stochastic differential equations.

General picture:
- forward SDE gradually perturbs data toward noise,
- reverse-time SDE reconstructs samples using the score field.

This viewpoint is powerful because it unifies:
- discrete diffusion models,
- score-based models,
- and continuous-time stochastic dynamics.

So diffusion is not just one narrow architecture family.
It is part of a deeper stochastic-process story.

## 6.11 Langevin dynamics intuition

The notes also explain the sampling intuition:
- start somewhere noisy,
- follow score information plus stochastic correction,
- move toward high-density regions.

That gives a very intuitive geometric view of generation.

## 6.12 U-Net and architecture

The denoiser is typically a time-conditioned U-Net.

Why U-Net?
Because it combines:
- multiscale processing,
- strong local spatial structure,
- skip connections that preserve detail,
- practical success in image-to-image denoising tasks.

The notes explicitly connect the diffusion denoiser to U-Net structure, and later to latent diffusion with cross-attention.

## 6.13 Classifier guidance

Conditioned generation can be done by combining:
- an unconditional diffusion score,
- plus the gradient from a classifier on noisy inputs.

Intuition:
- unconditional model says what looks like valid data,
- classifier says what direction increases likelihood of the desired class / condition.

This is elegant, but expensive and annoying because you need a robust noisy-input classifier.

## 6.14 Classifier-free guidance (CFG)

CFG is the cleaner modern trick.

Instead of training a separate classifier, train one conditional diffusion model that sometimes drops the condition during training.

Then at sampling time combine:
- unconditional score,
- conditional score,
- with a guidance weight $w$.

Interpretation:
- $w=0$ behaves more unconditional,
- larger $w$ prioritizes conditioning more strongly,
- too much $w$ can distort realism.

This is one of the most practically important tricks in modern diffusion.

## 6.15 DDIM and latent diffusion

The notes also point to:
- **DDIM** as a deterministic / implicit variant for faster or altered sampling,
- **latent diffusion** where diffusion happens in a learned latent representation rather than raw pixel space.

That latent move is massively practical:
- cheaper computation,
- better scaling,
- easier multimodal conditioning through cross-attention.

This is how modern text-to-image systems become feasible.

## 6.16 Diffusion mental model that actually sticks

Keep this picture:

1. define a known corruption process,
2. learn to undo small corruptions,
3. chain those denoising steps backward,
4. reinterpret the whole thing as score learning on noisy marginals,
5. use guidance to steer generation.

That is diffusion in one spine.

# Module 7: Language Models, Entropy, and Attention

## 7.1 Why LLMs belong in this course

Because an LLM is also a generative model. It just generates token sequences instead of images.

The sequence probability is built one token at a time from left to right.

In plain form:

`p(sequence) = p(x1) * p(x2 | x1) * p(x3 | x1, x2) * ... * p(xT | x1, ..., xT-1)`

So the model always predicts the next token using the tokens that came before it.

This is still distribution learning. The data modality changed. The generative principle did not.

## 7.2 Entropy and perplexity

The notes revisit Shannon-style ideas:
- entropy measures average uncertainty / compressibility,
- perplexity is the practical language-model metric derived from that predictive uncertainty.

A lower perplexity means the model is less surprised by the next token on average.

That is why perplexity becomes the immediate quality metric for predictive language models.

## 7.3 From Markov models to neural language models

The classical story:
- bigrams / trigrams assume tiny context dependence,
- histogram-like conditionals are too limited,
- modern models relax those assumptions using embeddings and neural networks.

This is the same pattern the whole course has repeated:
- naive explicit modeling is too brittle,
- learned representation makes the problem tractable.

## 7.4 Embeddings

Tokens are mapped from discrete vocabulary identities into continuous vectors.

That gives a geometry where words / tokens can have relational structure, rather than being isolated IDs.

## 7.5 Self-attention

The notes explain the standard query-key-value picture:
- queries ask what a token is looking for,
- keys describe what each token offers,
- values carry the content that gets mixed.

Attention computes relevance scores and weighted aggregation.

This is the mechanism that lets the model use long-range context instead of tiny local Markov assumptions.

## 7.6 Cross-attention

Cross-attention appears when the query stream and key-value stream come from different sources.

That matters in multimodal systems and also in latent diffusion, where conditioning information enters through cross-attention.

That is a beautiful course-level connection:

> the same attention idea shows up again when modern diffusion models condition on text or other modalities.

# Module 8: Geometric and 3D Generative AI Notes

## 8.1 Why the guest lecture matters

The guest lecture pushes an important message:

> modern generative systems are powerful, but they still struggle with geometric consistency, shape awareness, and 3D structure.

This matters a lot in embodied AI.

Robots do not live in 2D vibes.
They live in 3D geometry.

## 8.2 Shape-awareness problem

The lecture highlights failures like:
- wrong hand structure,
- multi-face artifacts,
- frontal-view bias,
- weak topological consistency.

So even impressive image generation does not automatically mean structurally grounded generation.

## 8.3 Why geometry helps

The lecture’s deep message is that geometric moments and structural controls can improve:
- consistency,
- controllability,
- parameter efficiency,
- and 2D/3D shape faithfulness.

This is exactly the kind of thing robotics should care about more than pure visual wow-factor.

## 8.4 Scene-graph and structured composition angle

Another big idea from the guest material is decomposition:
- parse scenes into objects and relations,
- generate or optimize components with explicit relational structure,
- avoid one-shot monolithic generation when composition matters.

That is a very robotics-compatible philosophy.

# What to Never Forget

1. High-dimensional explicit density estimation is doomed without structure.

2. Latent spaces are not decoration. They are compression and generative structure.

3. GANs train a generator through an adversarial game.

4. Vanilla GAN is tied to JS-style divergence behavior.

5. GAN failure modes are structural: vanishing gradients, collapse, oscillation.

6. WGAN changes the geometry by using Wasserstein distance.

7. WGAN-GP is the practical fix for critic Lipschitz enforcement.

# Intuition Anchors by Topic

## Probability model
A machine for assigning plausibility to possible worlds.

## Latent variable
Hidden cause / compressed coordinate of visible data.

## PCA
Linear version of “the data really lives in fewer dimensions.”

## GAN
A forger learning from a detective.

## Discriminator
A critic trained to detect mismatch between real and fake.

## Wasserstein distance
How much probability mass must be moved, and how far.

## MMD
Compare distributions by how differently a rich function class sees them.

## VAE
Probabilistic autoencoder with a real latent prior and variational discipline.

## ELBO
A tractable lower bound you optimize when exact likelihood is stubborn.

## Reparameterization trick
Make stochastic latent sampling differentiable by hiding randomness in a separate noise variable.

## Diffusion
Destroy data slowly, then learn how to undo the destruction.

## Score function
The vector field pointing uphill in log-density.

## CFG
Blend unconditional realism with conditional obedience.

## Perplexity
How many next-token guesses the model seems to be juggling on average.

## Attention
Context-sensitive routing of information.

# 30-Years-Later Refresher

If future-me forgets almost everything, remember this skeleton:

1. Generative AI is about learning **distributions**, not just outputs.
2. High-dimensional explicit density estimation is impossible without additional structure.
3. **PCA / PPCA** are the first latent-space models.
4. **GANs** learn by adversarial distribution matching.
5. **WGAN** swaps JS-like behavior for transport geometry.
6. **MMD / FID / IS** are evaluation tools, each incomplete in its own way.
7. **VAEs** use latent variables plus ELBO and approximate inference.
8. **Reparameterization** makes VAE training practical.
9. **Diffusion** learns to reverse a noising process.
10. Diffusion can be read as **score-based generative modeling**.
11. **Classifier-free guidance** is a practical steering trick for conditioned diffusion.
12. **LLMs** are autoregressive generative models over tokens.
13. For robotics and embodied AI, **geometry and consistency** matter as much as raw sample prettiness.

If this skeleton is alive, the rest can be rebuilt.

# Final Robotics Takeaway

This course teaches one deep lesson:

A generative model is not just a machine that makes fake samples.

It is:
- a probability model,
- a compression scheme,
- a latent-structure hypothesis,
- a distribution-matching system,
- a denoising process,
- a sequence predictor,
- and sometimes a geometry engine trying not to hallucinate nonsense.

The real jump from beginner to practitioner happens when you stop seeing GANs, VAEs, diffusion, and LLMs as separate trend buckets and start seeing them as different answers to the same question:

> how do we represent, learn, compare, and sample from complex data distributions?

That is when generative AI stops being hype wallpaper and starts becoming technical instinct.

# End Note

This is not just a course about image generators.

It is a course about how modern AI learns structure from randomness, and how different modeling choices trade off likelihood, sharpness, stability, control, and interpretability.
